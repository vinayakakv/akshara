# Akshara Tools

A set of tools to run computations on Indic Scripts

## Local Development

1. Have [bun](https://oven.sh/bun) installed and make sure that it is found in the path
2. Clone the git repo and `cd` to it
3. Install the dependencies - `bun i`
4. Development server - `bun dev`; it supports HMR, so no need to restart dev after code changes
